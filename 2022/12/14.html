		<d> A dream I had </d>
		<p> I dreamt I was somewhere in an office building. I walked down long, empty hallways and met a woman with gray hair at the front desk. She gave me some instructions. Soon I was in a large room that was to be my office. </p>
		<p> I was assigned to investigate two objects. The first was a set of five dice near a tumble dryer for clothes. I ran the dryer. For about thirty minutes I sat listening to the hum, waiting to see if something would happen. </p>
		<p> After that time and then some, I began to hear clanging from within the dryer. When the cycle finished, three more dice identical the those on my desk were inside the dryer. </p>
		<p> The second object to investigate was a small figure made of building blocks. I removed the figure from its box and it began to scream in a high, tinny voice. </p>
		<p> It flipped and bumped around on the table as well. I watched it for some time, unsure of what to do. </p>
		<p> Soon, the figure bumped into another piece of building block, which connected to it with a loud SNAP. </p>
		<p> Instantly it went still and silent. </p>
		<p> I watched the inert toy for what felt like minutes, incredulous, and then I woke up. </p>
